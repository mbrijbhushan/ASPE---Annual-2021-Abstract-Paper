  abstract        = {Many applications require measurements using an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Such applications will have resolution requirements based in the signal's dynamic range, the smallest change in a parameter that must be measured, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For this reason, many systems employ a higher resolution off-chip ADC. However, there are techniques that can be used to achieve higher resolution measurements and SNR. This application note describes utilizing oversampling and averaging to increase the resolution and SNR of analog-to-digital conversions. Oversampling and averaging can increase the resolution of a measurement without resorting to the cost and complexity of using expensive off-chip ADCs. This application note discusses how to increase the resolution of analog-to-digital (ADC) measure- ments by oversampling and averaging. Addition- ally, more in-depth analysis of ADC noise, types of ADC noise optimal for oversampling techniques, and example code utilizing oversampling and aver- aging is provided in appendices A, B, and C respectively at the end of this document.},

@book{Smith1997,
  abstract        = {Markets have always influenced the central thrust of the semiconductor industry. Beginning in the early eighties, the personal computer (PC) market has been the dominant market influencing the semiconductor industry. Single-chip microprocessors (MPUs) enabled what became the huge PC market, which ultimately overshadowed the earlier minicomputer and mainframe computer markets. The popularity of PCs led to investments in increasingly more powerful MPUs and memory chips of ever-growing capacity. MPUs and DRAMs became the semiconductor industry technology drivers for the data processing needs of the PC. But now, DSP, as opposed to conventional data processing, has become the major technology driver for the semiconductor industry as evidenced by its market growth and the fervour of chip vendors to provide new products based on DSP technology. The increasing need to digitally process analog information signals, like audio and video, is causing a major shift in the semiconductor business. Since DSP is the mathematical manipulation of those digitized information signals, specialized math circuitry is required for efficient signal processing-circuitry that was previously confined to classical DSP chips},
