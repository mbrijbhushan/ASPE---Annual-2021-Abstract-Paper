## readme.txt

This repository contains the LaTeX templates needed to properly format manuscripts for conference proceedings of the American Society for Precision Engineering. The files were originally written by Hans-Jochen Trost of MicroFab Technologies, lightly edited in 2019 to remove out-of-date content, and last compiled in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) on March 18, 2019.
